Homework 1: Background Material (written / programming)<br />

Homework 2: Decision Trees (written / programming)<br />
	- The project builds a binary classifier from scratch which uses<br />
 	Decision tree as its core for learning and inference.
  	The algorithm uses mutual information as splitting criterion.
   
Homework 3: KNN, Perceptron, Linear Regression (written)

Homework 4: Logistic Regression (written / programming)
	- This project builds a sentiment analyzer capable of analyzing
 	the overall sentiment polarity using 2 different feature 
  	extraction techniques.
   
Homework 5: Neural Networks (written / programming)                                                                                                                

Homework 6: Generative Models (written)                                                                                                                

Homework 7: Hidden Markov Models (written / programming)
	- Implemented a "new named entity recognition system" using HMM
 
Homework 8: Reinforcement Learning (written / programming)

Homework 9: SVMs, K-Means, PCA, Boosting (written)
